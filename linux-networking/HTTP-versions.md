Let’s go deep into **HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3**, covering:

* how each version works under the hood,
* protocol design differences,
* connection management,
* multiplexing,
* compression,
* security, and
* real-world performance implications.

---

## ⚙️ 1. HTTP/1.1 — Classic, Connection-Oriented

### 🔹 Background

Released in **1997**, HTTP/1.1 was designed for simplicity and broad compatibility. It’s **text-based** and works over **TCP**.

---

### 🔸 How it Works

1. **Connection Setup**

   * Uses TCP three-way handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK).
   * Then, optional TLS handshake (if HTTPS) is done on top.

2. **Request/Response Flow**

   * A client sends a **request line** (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`), headers, and optional body.
   * Server replies with a **status line**, headers, and optional body.
   * Everything is ASCII text.

3. **Pipelining (optional)**

   * HTTP/1.1 *allows* sending multiple requests on a single TCP connection before responses arrive.
   * But — responses must be sent in **the same order as requests**.
     → Causes **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking**.
     → Most browsers disabled pipelining due to this.

### 🔸 Performance Characteristics

| Feature               | HTTP/1.1                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Transport             | TCP                                     |
| Multiplexing          | ❌ No — one request per connection       |
| Head-of-line blocking | ✅ Yes                                   |
| Compression           | ❌ None (headers sent as plain text)     |
| Security              | Optional TLS                            |
| Connection reuse      | ✅ Keep-Alive                            |
| Prioritization        | ❌ None                                  |
| Typical optimization  | Domain sharding, sprites, concatenation |

---

### 🔸 Issues

* **Inefficient for multiple resources** (modern webpages load 100+ files).
* Multiple TCP connections per origin (usually 6 per domain).
* **HOL blocking at TCP and HTTP level**.
* Header overhead — each request repeats long headers like `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, etc.

---

## ⚙️ 2. HTTP/2 — Binary Multiplexed Revolution

### 🔹 Background

Released in **2015**, based on Google’s SPDY project.
Still uses **TCP** but fundamentally changes how data is framed and sent.

---

### 🔸 How it Works

1. **Binary Framing Layer**

   * Replaces text-based messages with **binary frames**.
   * Frames are grouped into **streams**, each representing a request/response pair.

2. **Multiplexing**

   * Multiple streams share one TCP connection.
   * Frames from different streams interleave freely — no need to wait for one to finish.
   * Solves HTTP-level HOL blocking.

3. **Header Compression (HPACK)**

   * Compresses repetitive headers.
   * Maintains a dynamic table shared between client and server to avoid resending identical headers.

4. **Server Push**

   * Server can send resources (like CSS or JS) *before* the client requests them.

5. **Stream Prioritization**

   * Allows clients to assign weights/dependencies between streams.

### 🔸 Performance Characteristics

| Feature               | HTTP/2                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Transport             | TCP                                            |
| Multiplexing          | ✅ Yes (multiple requests over one connection)  |
| Head-of-line blocking | ⚠️ Yes, *at TCP layer*                         |
| Header Compression    | ✅ HPACK                                        |
| Security              | Practically always with TLS (ALPN negotiation) |
| Server Push           | ✅ Yes (now deprecated in practice)             |
| Prioritization        | ✅ Supported                                    |
| Binary Protocol       | ✅ Yes                                          |

---

### 🔸 Issues

* Still limited by **TCP HOL blocking**.
  If a single packet is lost, TCP pauses *all* streams until retransmission completes.
* Complex prioritization logic not always respected by browsers.
* Server Push adoption has declined (replaced by `103 Early Hints` or HTTP/3 preloading).

---

## ⚙️ 3. HTTP/3 — QUIC & UDP-Based Modernization

### 🔹 Background

Standardized in **2022**, built over **QUIC**, which itself runs over **UDP**.
Developed by Google and IETF to eliminate TCP’s latency and HOL blocking issues.

---

### 🔸 How it Works

1. **QUIC Transport Layer**

   * Replaces TCP with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections).
   * QUIC includes:

     * **Stream multiplexing**
     * **Congestion control**
     * **Encryption (TLS 1.3 integrated)**
     * **Packet-level retransmission**

   ➜ QUIC is essentially *TCP+TLS+HTTP2 multiplexing* fused into a single layer over UDP.

2. **Connection Establishment**

   * Uses 0-RTT or 1-RTT connection setup:

     * **0-RTT:** Client can send encrypted data immediately using session resumption.
     * **1-RTT:** One round trip for handshake (faster than TCP+TLS 1.2’s 2–3 RTTs).

3. **Independent Streams**

   * Each stream is independently reliable.
   * Loss in one stream doesn’t block others.
   * Solves HOL blocking even at transport layer.

4. **Header Compression (QPACK)**

   * Similar to HPACK but designed to avoid blocking issues in QUIC.

| Server Push           | ✅ Supported (rarely used)                              |
| Binary Protocol       | ✅ Yes                                                  |

### 🔸 Advantages

* **No TCP HOL blocking.**
* **Faster connection setup** (1-RTT or 0-RTT).
* **Better performance on mobile networks** (connection migration).
* **Lower latency and jitter**, particularly in lossy networks.

---

### 🔸 Challenges

* Requires **UDP allowed by firewalls** (some corporate networks block it).
* **Implementation complexity** — QUIC runs in user space, not kernel.
* **Higher CPU cost** due to encryption and user-space handling.

## 🔍 Quick Mental Model

* **HTTP/1.1** → One lane road. Each car (request) must wait in line.
* **HTTP/2** → Multi-lane highway, but if one car crashes (packet loss), *all lanes stop* (TCP HOL).
* **HTTP/3** → Independent self-driving lanes (UDP streams). One crash doesn’t stop others.
