## ‚ÄúToo Many File Descriptors‚Äù 

When you see an error like:

```
Too many open files
```

it means a process (or sometimes the whole system) has hit a **limit on the number of file descriptors** it can have open **at the same time**.

---

## üß© Why It Happens ‚Äî The FD Architecture Recap

Let‚Äôs recall the key parts:

1. Each **process** has its own **file descriptor table** (per-process limit).
2. The **kernel** also maintains a **global file table** (system-wide limit).
3. Each **open socket, file, or pipe** consumes one FD entry.

So, when you see ‚Äútoo many open files,‚Äù it means:

* The process‚Äôs FD table is full (common case), **or**
* The system-wide file table is full (rare, but possible).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical FD Limits

You can check limits with:

### Per-process limit:

```bash
ulimit -n
```

Example output:

```
1024
```

That means a single process can have **1024 open files/sockets/pipes**.

You can see this in more detail with:

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/limits
```

### System-wide limit:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
```

Example:

```
9223372036854775807
```

That‚Äôs the **global limit** for all processes combined.

---

## üß† Common Scenarios Where This Happens

### 1. üï≥Ô∏è **File Descriptor Leak**

* A program **opens files or sockets** repeatedly **without closing** them.
* Common in buggy code or long-running daemons.
* Example: a web server opening connections but never calling `close(fd)`.

Check:

```bash
lsof -p <pid> | wc -l
```

If this grows continuously, you have an FD leak.

---

### 2. üîå **Too Many Network Connections**

* Each **TCP connection** uses an FD.
* If your service (e.g., Nginx, Redis, or Node.js app) handles tens of thousands of clients, it can hit the limit.

Fix: Increase the limit with:

```bash
ulimit -n 65535
```

---

### 3. üìÅ **Huge Directory Listing**

* Tools like `find`, `tar`, or `rsync` can open many files at once, especially when working on directories with millions of files.

These temporarily hit the FD limit.

---

### 4. üîÅ **FD Duplication (dup, fork loops)**

* Each forked child inherits parent‚Äôs FDs.
* If you fork in a loop without closing, the number multiplies rapidly.

---

### 5. üß© **System-wide Exhaustion**

* Happens when **many processes** (like thousands of containers or threads) collectively open millions of FDs.
* Then the global `/proc/sys/fs/file-max` limit is reached.
* The kernel logs:

  ```
  VFS: file-max limit reached
  ```

---

## üß∞ How to Debug

### 1. Check which process has the most FDs

```bash
sudo lsof | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
```

### 2. Count FDs for a specific process

```bash
ls /proc/<pid>/fd | wc -l
```

### 3. View current limits

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/limits
```

### 4. Check system-wide FD usage

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
```

Output:

```
32128   0   2097152
```

This means:

* 32128 FDs are currently used.
* 0 are free but allocated.
* 2097152 is the system-wide max.

---

## üßØ How to Fix or Prevent It

### Temporary (current shell)

```bash
ulimit -n 65535
```

### Persistent (for a service)

* Edit systemd service unit:

  ```
  [Service]
  LimitNOFILE=65535
  ```

  Then reload and restart:

  ```bash
  systemctl daemon-reexec
  systemctl restart myservice
  ```

### Permanent (for all users)

Add to `/etc/security/limits.conf` or `/etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf`:

```
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535
```

Or for root only:

```
root soft nofile 65535
root hard nofile 65535
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OOM Kill vs FD Limit

These are **different** mechanisms:

| Issue        | Trigger                               | Handled by                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **FD Limit** | Process opened too many files         | Kernel returns `EMFILE` error          |
| **OOM Kill** | System ran out of memory (RAM + swap) | Kernel OOM killer terminates processes |

In FD exhaustion, the process usually **doesn‚Äôt get killed**, but its I/O syscalls fail.

---

## üí° Real-world Example

You might see this in logs:

```
Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch
```

‚Üí Common with Node.js file watchers or Prometheus exporters monitoring many files.

Or:

```
accept4: Too many open files
```

‚Üí Web server can‚Äôt accept new client connections because sockets = FDs.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ How the Kernel Tracks File Descriptors

Linux separates **per-process FD table** and **system-wide file table**:

### A. Per-Process FD Table

* Every process has its own **file descriptor table** stored in its `task_struct`.
* Think of it as an **array of integers** where each index is an FD (0,1,2,3‚Ä¶).
* Each entry points to an entry in the **kernel‚Äôs global file table**.
* Example:

```
FD table for PID 1234:
0 ‚Üí points to global file table entry for stdin
1 ‚Üí points to global file table entry for stdout
2 ‚Üí points to global file table entry for stderr
3 ‚Üí points to global file table entry for /home/syam/file.txt
```

* Maximum number of FDs per process = **ulimit -n** (soft/hard limit).

### B. Kernel Global File Table

* The **kernel maintains metadata** for every open file:

  * File offset
  * Access flags (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY)
  * Reference count (how many FDs point to it)
* Multiple processes can share the same global entry (common with `fork()`).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Process Lifecycle & FD Allocation

1. **Process starts**

   * Kernel sets up FD table with 0,1,2 (stdin/stdout/stderr).
2. **Process opens a file**

   * Kernel:

     * Finds a free slot in the **per-process FD table** ‚Üí returns it as the FD.
     * Allocates (or points to) an entry in the **global file table**.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     open("file.txt", O_RDONLY) ‚Üí returns FD 3
     ```
3. **Process forks**

   * Child inherits parent FD table.
   * Each FD in child points to the **same global file table entry** (reference count incremented).
4. **Process closes FD**

   * Kernel decrements reference count in global file table.
   * If count reaches zero ‚Üí kernel releases the entry.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ When ‚ÄúToo Many File Descriptors‚Äù Happens

Linux can return **EMFILE** (per-process limit) or **ENFILE** (system-wide limit):

### A. EMFILE ‚Äì Per-process limit

* Happens when **all slots in the FD table of the process are occupied**.
* Example:

  * `ulimit -n = 1024`
  * Process tries to open 1025th file ‚Üí kernel returns **EMFILE: Too many open files**
* Usually a **leak or high number of concurrent files/sockets**.

### B. ENFILE ‚Äì System-wide limit

* Happens when **global file table is full**.
* Example:

  * Too many processes opening files collectively ‚Üí system hits `/proc/sys/fs/file-max`.
  * Rare, only in heavily loaded systems (many processes, containers, sockets).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Points About FD Limits

1. **Per-process FD table** lives in `task_struct->files->fdt`.

   * Kernel keeps track of which FDs are free/used.
   * Max = `ulimit -n`.
2. **Global file table** lives in kernel memory:

   * Each entry has reference count.
   * If too many files open ‚Üí system-wide exhaustion.
3. **Fork inheritance**:

   * Child FDs point to the same global file table entry.
   * Still counted against **per-process table**, not global table.
4. **Close frees FD slot**:

   * Only then can a new file be opened in that process.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Example Flow

Let‚Äôs say `bash` wants to open 3 files in a loop:

```c
for i in 0..1025:
    fd = open("/tmp/testfile", O_RDONLY)
```

Kernel steps:

1. Checks **per-process FD table**:

   * Is there a free slot?

     * Yes ‚Üí assign FD ‚Üí link to global file table.
     * No ‚Üí return **EMFILE**
2. Checks **global file table**:

   * Is there a free entry in the global table?

     * Yes ‚Üí allocate
     * No ‚Üí return **ENFILE**

If you don‚Äôt close any file (leak), eventually `ulimit -n` is hit ‚Üí **EMFILE**.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Real-world Examples

| Scenario                                        | What Fails                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Web server with 50k clients, ulimit = 1024      | EMFILE on `accept()`            |
| Node.js file watcher on 200k files              | EMFILE on `inotify_add_watch()` |
| System with thousands of processes opening logs | ENFILE globally                 |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Prevention & Fix

1. **Increase per-process limit**

```bash
ulimit -n 65535
```

Or in systemd unit:

```
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65535
```

2. **Increase system-wide limit**

```bash
echo 2097152 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
```

3. **Close unused FDs**

* Make sure your program calls `close(fd)`.

4. **Use `select/poll/epoll` efficiently**

* Don‚Äôt open new FDs for every client if you can reuse.

5. **Monitor**

```bash
lsof -p <pid> | wc -l
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* **FD = small integer handle** for any I/O resource.
* **Per-process table** ‚Üí limit via `ulimit -n`.
* **Global table** ‚Üí system-wide limit via `file-max`.
* ‚ÄúToo many open files‚Äù = FD table full ‚Üí kernel returns EMFILE.
* Proper cleanup (`close`) or increasing limits prevents this.
